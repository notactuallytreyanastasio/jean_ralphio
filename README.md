# Jean Ralphio

## Overview
This is a project that sets out to make an extremely bad piece of software.
It will consist of several parts with my initial idea/attempt.

1. A Ruby implementation of the version control system `git`
2. A database built atop that, in Ruby as well
3. A transpilation layer that will leveral `Opal` to transpile both of these to have a JavaScript implementation
4. A JavaScript implementation of the version control system `git`
5. A database built atop that, in JavaScript as well
6. A toolchain to deploy each of these services to a different VPS
7. A hand-rolled made-up-as-I-go consesnsus protocol to syncronize these multiple deployed database nodes

It is called Jean Ralpio because it is in face 'the woooOOOooooOOorst'

## Development Plan
I will be starting with the ruby implementation of `git`, then move onto the database layer.
Transpilation will come after that.

I am saving the JavaScript implementation for last as an excuse to learn the latest and greatest in JS.
I will for sure be using a bunch of top level await and stuff like that.
